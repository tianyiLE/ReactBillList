# BillList

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to the BillList project! BillList is an intuitive financial tracking application designed to help users monitor and record their various income and expenditure records efficiently. With a user-friendly interface and easy navigation, BillList aims to simplify personal finance management for everyone.

## Features

BillList is structured around three main pages, each designed to cater to different aspects of personal financial management:

### 1. Monthly Bills

The Monthly Bills page is the go-to destination for users looking to review their income and expenditure records for any given month. This feature allows users to quickly glance at their financial activities, helping them make informed decisions about their spending habits and budget management.

### 2. Add New Record

The Add New Record page is a straightforward and accessible way for users to input a new income or expenditure record. Whether it's a regular income source or an unexpected expense, this feature ensures that all financial activities can be easily added to the user's account, keeping their records up-to-date.

### 3. Annual Bills

The Annual Bills page provides users with a comprehensive overview of their yearly financial activities. By aggregating income and expenditure records on an annual basis, users can assess their financial health over the long term, identify trends in their spending and earning patterns, and plan for the future more effectively.
